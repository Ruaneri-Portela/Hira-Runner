# Hira-Runner
Infinite run game for training attention and focus, aimed at individuals with ADHD
This project is a clean base clone of Giulia Toddin's original project (https://github.com/giuliatondin/unity-mindwave-runner)

This project is about a game aimed at children especially with ADHD, but it can be used to improve attention and focus, and also to monitor and abstract information about the patient's cognitive state.

The game is a generic endless runner, aiming to collect stars and I got the highest score possible!
